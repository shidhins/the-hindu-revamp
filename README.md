the-hindu-revamp
================

A cleaner interface for a better reading experience of India's most trusted newspaper. No configurations, just [get the extension][https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-hindu-revamp/iljpefbhclkoadkooeidbkkmfgcmmmok/details] and continue reading thehindu.com. Only better this time !

###Installation

Get the chrome add-on [here][https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-hindu-revamp/iljpefbhclkoadkooeidbkkmfgcmmmok/details]

###Current State

Currently the extension only adds custom styles to the site http://thehindu.com. The rationale for releasing styles as a separate extension is to keep the options open as far as future enhancements are concerned.

###Future Plans
- alter and optimize the layout
- enhance UX with scripts and helper libraries
